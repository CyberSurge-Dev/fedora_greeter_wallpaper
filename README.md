# Gnome GDM Greeter Background Switcher
A simple script and service to automatically change the Gnome GDM login screen background on each power cycle (Similar to how it is done with windows). This script has been tested to work on the latest version of fedora workstation (as of writing, version 42), it has not been tested on any other distrubutions, so use at your own risk.
